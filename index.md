# Paraphin Inc.

We build [responsive][1] [single page apps][2] with Javascript, Node.js, and SASS.

## Software Stack - BREW

* [Backbone.js][3] - a minimal framework that makes single page apps easier to develop
* [React.js][4] - a library that uses JSX to make UI components with very fast data binding
* [Express][5] - Node.js's webapp framework, which organizes the backend very well
* [Webpack][6] - Packages assets into optimized bundles to reduce network load

## Workflow

Some of us use [Sublime Text][7], while others use [Atom][8] for text editing. Ben has been working on a cross-platform Sublime plugin to compile SASS files (see [github.com/blitzrk/libsass-build-sublime](https://github.com/blitzrk/libsass-build-sublime)).

## Xoshoal

For the backend, we are using a mix of Redis, MongoDB, and Neo4j for data storage. For the frontend, we are using [Bourbon][9] and [Neat][10] as a SASS framework. For now, we are creating all of our UI elements from scratch.
